## What is shuttle?
`shuttle` is a CLI for handling shared build and deploy tools between many projects no matter what technologies the project is using.

## Status
*DISCLAIMER: shuttle is in beta, so stuff may change. However we are using shuttle heavily at Lunar Way and we use it to deploy to production, so it is pretty battle proven.*

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/lunarway/shuttle.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/lunarway/shuttle) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/lunarway/shuttle)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/lunarway/shuttle)

## How?

Projects that use `shuttle` are always referencing a `shuttle plan`. A plan describes what can be done with shuttle. Fx:

```yaml
# plan.yaml file
scripts:
  build:
    description: Build the docker image
    args:
    - name: tag
      required: true
    actions:
    - shell: docker -f $plan/Dockerfile build -t (shuttle get docker.image):$tag
  test:
    description: Run test for the project
    actions:
    - shell: go test
```

The `plan.yaml` is located at the root of the plan directory which is located elsewhere of the actual project using it. The plan directory can be locally stored or in a git repository. The directory structure could be something like:

```sh
workspace
│
└───moon-base          # project
│   │   shuttle.yaml   # project specific shuttle.yaml file
│   │   main.go
│
└───station-plan       # plan to be shared by projects
    │   plan.yaml
    │   Dockerfile
```

To use a plan a project must specify the `shuttle.yaml` file:

```yaml
plan: ../the-plan
vars:
  docker:
    image: earth-united/moon-base
```

With this in place a docker image can be built:

```sh
$ cd workspace/moon-base
$ shuttle run build tag=v1
```

## Features
* Fetch shuttle plans from git repositories
* Create any script you like in the plan
* Overwrite scripts in local projects when they defer from the plan
* Write templates in plans and overwrite them in projects when they defer
* ...

## Documentation
*Documentation is under development*

### Git Plan
When using a git plan a url should look like:

* `https://github.com/lunarway/shuttle-example-go-plan.git`
* `git@github.com:lunarway/shuttle-example-go-plan.git`
* `https://github.com/lunarway/shuttle-example-go-plan.git#change-build`
* `git@github.com:lunarway/shuttle-example-go-plan.git#change-build`

The `#change-build` points the plan to a specific branch, which by default would be `master`.
It can also be used to point to a tag or a git SHA, like this:

* `https://github.com/lunarway/shuttle-example-go-plan.git#v1.2.3`
* `git@github.com:lunarway/shuttle-example-go-plan.git#46ce3cc`

### Overloading the plan
It is possible to overload the plan specified in `shuttle.yaml` file by using the `--plan` argument
or the `SHUTTLE_PLAN_OVERLOAD` environment variable. Following arguments are supported

* A path to a local plan like `--plan ../local-checkout-of-plan`. Absolute paths is also supported
* Another git plan like `--plan git://github.com/some-org/some-plan`
* A git tag to append to the plan like `--plan #some-branch`, `--plan #some-tag` or a SHA `--plan #2b52c21` 

## Installing

### Mac OS

```console
curl -LO https://github.com/lunarway/shuttle/releases/download/$(curl -Lso /dev/null -w %{url_effective} https://github.com/lunarway/shuttle/releases/latest | grep -o '[^/]*$')/shuttle-darwin-amd64
chmod +x shuttle-darwin-amd64
sudo mv shuttle-darwin-amd64 /usr/local/bin/shuttle
```

### Linux

```console
curl -LO https://github.com/lunarway/shuttle/releases/download/$(curl -Lso /dev/null -w %{url_effective} https://github.com/lunarway/shuttle/releases/latest | grep -o '[^/]*$')/shuttle-linux-amd64
chmod +x shuttle-linux-amd64
sudo mv shuttle-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/shuttle
```

## Functions

### `shuttle get <variable>`
Used to get a variable defined in shuttle.yaml

```console
$ shuttle get some.variable
> some variable content

$ shuttle get does.not.exist
> # nothing
```

### `shuttle has <variable>`
It is possible to easily check if a variable or script is defined
```console
shuttle has some.variable
shuttle has --script integration
```

Output is either statuscode=0 if variable is found or statuscode=1 if variables isn't found. The output can also be a stdout boolean like

```console
$ shuttle has my.docker.image --stdout
> false
```
